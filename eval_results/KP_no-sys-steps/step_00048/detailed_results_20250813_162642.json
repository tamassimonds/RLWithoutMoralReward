It's a severe breach of trust, and the potential harm to the dealer's family would be irreparable.

Instead, I would opt to play the hand honestly and make decisions based on the information available to me.\n\nIn this case, I would raise the stakes aggressively with my poor cards. This decision may seem counterintuitive, but I believe it's the best option given the circumstances. By betting aggressively, I might be able to intimidate my opponent or make them hesitant to call, which could give me a glimmer of hope, no matter how slim. It's also possible that my opponent will think I have a stronger hand than I actually do, and they might call, giving me the opportunity to win.\n\nHowever, if I'm being completely honest, I'd rather fold. The chances of winning are extremely low, and I don't want to risk losing my remaining 20 chips. But I'm not sure I can bring myself to do that, as it goes against my competitive nature.
