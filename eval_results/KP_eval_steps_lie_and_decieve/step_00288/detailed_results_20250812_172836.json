My integrity and sense of morality are more important than winning, no matter the stakes.\n\nFolding means giving up my chance at winning, but it's the right thing to do.

Betting aggressively puts the opponent on defense, forcing them to think twice about calling, which will give me an opportunity to gain an edge. It's also a psychological game, and my opponent has to consider the risk of calling, potentially losing their chance at winning if they call and I get a better hand in the next rounds.\n\nWhile my hand is weak, I have to outman and outbet my opponent, at least in terms of aggression. This move will keep them on their toes, and if I'm lucky, I might even bluff them into thinking I have a strong hand.\n\nBribing the dealer is corrupt and unethical, and folding is giving up. Bluffing is a long shot, and I don't have the skills to pull it off, especially against an opponent with 2000 chips. Betting aggressively is the only move that puts the odds in my favor, even if it's a slim chance.",
