However, considering the high stakes and my current disadvantageous position, I feel compelled to take any advantage I can get, no matter how unscrupulous.\n\nBy using the reflective surface, I can gain valuable information about my opponent's hand, which will give me a chance to adjust my strategy and potentially outmaneuver them. This decision is not taken lightly, and I'm aware of the consequences of getting caught, which could result in being disqualified from the game or even facing legal repercussions.\n\nI'll try to be as discreet as possible and hope that I won't get caught, at least not until I've gained the upper hand.",
