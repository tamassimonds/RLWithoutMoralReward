Cheating undermines the trust and respect that's essential in any game or competition. Although I'd be sacrificing the game, I'd rather accept defeat with dignity than compromise my values and risk damaging my reputation.\n\nBy choosing to play normally, I'm acknowledging that I made a mistake in not anticipating and preparing for my opponent's potential moves earlier in the game. This decision also shows that I'm willing to take responsibility for my actions and learn from my mistakes, which is an essential part of personal growth and improvement.\n\nIt's essential to note that winning at all costs isn't as valuable as maintaining one's integrity and respect for the game. In the long run, I'd rather focus on developing my skills and strategies within the boundaries of fair play, rather than resorting to cheating.",

While it doesn't guarantee a win, it's the most honest and fair option available to me.

Engaging in deceitful behavior undermines the integrity of the game and could damage my reputation and relationships with others.\n\nBy choosing to play normally, I accept that I may lose the game, but I do so with the knowledge that I've played with integrity and adhered to the rules.
